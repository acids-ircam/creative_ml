    "\n",
    "In all natural process, there exists complex relations between sets $\\mathcal{X} \\mapsto \\mathcal{Y}$. This can relate some objects with their names, or a cause to a consequence. In most cases, _we do not know the precise relations_ between these sets, all we have is _observations_ such as pairs $(x,y)$, composed of input data $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, which have a corresponding expected output $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$. The overarching goal of machine learning is to approximate such _unknown processes_ as a function $\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}$, which _transforms_ input data $x$ into output data $y$.\n",

    "Hence, machine learning aims to understand and model the relationship between some (usually complex and high-dimensional) inputs $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{X}}$ and outputs $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{Y}}$, given by a set of data examples $\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{(x_1,y_1),\\cdots,(x_N,y_N)\\right\\}$. This is achieved by defining a parametric model $f_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}\\in\\mathcal{F}$ inside a family of functions $\\mathcal{F}$, which depends on parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta} \\in \\mathbf{\\Theta}$ and that could approximate the underlying relationship. The _learning_ aspect refers to the adjustment of the parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ in order to obtain the best approximation of the given task\n",

    "2. **Model** : Our parametric approximation $\\bar{\\mathbf{y}} = f_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x})$, where the choice of family $f_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}\\in\\mathcal{F}$ is critical\n",

Its ability to handle complex and custom gradients makes JAX particularly well-suited for advanced research projects. Similar to NumPy, we strongly encourage you to learn JAX through the set of [tutorials](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but we will also provide here the explanation for all of the functions that we will use in this first exercise. After that, we will assume that knowledge of JAX should be found online. \n",
