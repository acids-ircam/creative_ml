    "\n",
    "Along the tutorials, we provide a reference code for each section. \n",
    "This code contains helper functions that will alleviate you from the burden of data import and other sideline implementations. \n",
    "You will find designated spaces in each file to develop your solutions. \n",
    "The code is in Python (notebooks impending) and relies on the concept of [Jupyter Notebooks](http://www.jupyter.org), which allows you to interactively follow the course and evaluate only part of the code (to avoid running long import tasks multiple times and concentrate on the question at hand).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although you can follow this course entirely online, we highly recommend that you rather fork the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/esling/creative_ml) and setup your own environment (see next section). This will allow you to pursue research in machine learning directly after the course.**\n",

    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the baseline scripts and notebooks to work, you need to have a working distribution of `Python 3.7` as a minimum (we also recommend to update your version to `Python 3.9`). We will also be using a large set of libraries (as detailed in the next section)\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend that you install [Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) that will manage the automatic installation of those Python libraries (along with their dependencies). If you are using `Pip`, you can use the following commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to install all the libraries by hand to check their version, you can use individual commands\n",

    "#### Jupyter notebooks and lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ease following the exercises along with the course, we will be relying on [**Jupyter Notebooks**](https://jupyter.org/). If you have never used a notebook before, we recommend that you look at their website to understand the concept. Here we also provide the instructions to install **Jupyter Lab** which is a more integrative version of notebooks. You can install it on your computer as follows (if you use `pip`)\n",
